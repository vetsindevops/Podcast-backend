Welcome contributors to the project: We are excited you found your way to VetsinDevOps.
   docs: handbook / roadmap (Check the main project board
   bugs: issue tracker / bug report tool
   comms: [vetsindevops] ("vetsindevops.com")
Testing: Still a work in progress
Environment details: The enviorement is private due to cost of cloud resources and the admins with access to the secrets. You can easily replicate or contribute without deploying real infra.
How to submit changes: Pull Request protocol etc. We are a very small team and will do our best
How to report a bug: Bugs are problems in code, in the functionality of an application or in its UI design; you can submit them through "bug trackers" and most projects invite you to do so, so that they may "debug" with more efficiency and the input of a contributor. Take a look at Atom's example for how to teach people to report bugs to your project.
Templates: in this section of your file, you might also want to link to a bug report "template" like this one here which contributors can copy and add context to; this will keep your bugs tidy and relevant.
First bugs for Contributors: Sometimes it is helpful to provide some guidelines for the types of bugs contributors should tackle (should they want to fix the bugs and not just submit them), see Atom's example section here.
How to request an "enhancement" - enhancements are features that you might like to suggest to a project, but aren't necessarily bugs/problems with the existing code; there is a "label" for enhancments in Github's Issues (where you report bugs), so you can tag issues as "enhancement," and thereby allow contributors to prioritize issues/bugs reported to the project. See Atom's example section.
